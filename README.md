# Explore-a-Housing-Prices-Dataset-Using-Pandas
Dataset
Use the Kaggle dataset “Housing Price Prediction”, which includes house details such as price, area, number of bedrooms, furnished status, and proximity to main roads.


# Part 1: Setup & Load Data
Download the CSV from Kaggle.
Load it into pandas:
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('housing_prices.csv')


# Part 2: Explore & Clean Data
Use df.head() and df.describe() to get an overview.
Check and handle any missing values.


# Part 3: Compute Statistics
For numerical columns like:

Price
Area
Bedrooms
Compute the following using pandas:
mean()
median()
mode()
var()
std()
skew()
kurt()
min(), max()


# Part 4: Optional Visualization
Plot histograms or box plots for Price and Area.
Use scatter plots like Price vs Area if you want to show trends.


# Part 5: Storytelling
Write a 5–8 sentence story describing your findings:

What do average and spread of prices tell?
Are there any outliers or surprises?
Does the data show consistency or big differences?
What insights can someone take from this housing market?
